# Introduction to Torii

Torii is a powerful authentication framework for Rust applications that gives you complete control over your users' data. Unlike hosted solutions like Auth0, Clerk, or WorkOS that store user information in their cloud, Torii lets you own and manage your authentication stack while providing modern auth features through a flexible plugin system.

With Torii, you get the best of both worlds - powerful authentication capabilities combined with full data sovereignty and the ability to store user data wherever you choose.
