# Introduction to Torii

Torii is a powerful authentication framework for Rust applications that gives you complete control over your users' data. Unlike hosted solutions like Auth0, Clerk, or WorkOS that store user information in their cloud, Torii lets you own and manage your authentication stack while providing modern auth features through a flexible plugin system.

## Key Features

- **Data Sovereignty**: Your user data stays in your own database
- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Support for passwords, OAuth, passkeys, and magic links
- **Flexible Storage**: Store user data in SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL
- **Extensible Plugin System**: Add custom authentication methods or storage backends
